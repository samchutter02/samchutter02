🌌 About Me
Hello! My name is Sam Chutter, and I am an aspiring software engineer located in the Hill Country, TX. Currently, I’m using React Native with Expo and developing a software that detects dangerous objects and areas in Alzheimer's patients' rooms, as well as a Swift-based migraine app dedicated to granular visual aura data research.
