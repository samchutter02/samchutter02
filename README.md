# About Me

Hello! My name is **Sam Chutter**, and I’m an aspiring software engineer based in the Hill Country, TX.

I’m currently working on:

- A **React Native** + **Expo** app and ai model to detect dangerous objects and areas in the rooms of Alzheimer's patients.
- Converting my existing **Swift**-based migraine tracking app focused on granular visual aura data for research purposes to **React Native**.
- A **React and Tailwind**-based web app to facilitate project connections more intuitively between students and faculty within Texas State University's Center for Analytics and Data Science.
